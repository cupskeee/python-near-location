## About the Project
### Built With

This app is created using **Python 3** only.

Reference is from [Wikipedia on Haversine Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)

## Getting Started

This script is to calculate the great-circle distance between inputted coordinates e.g your coordinate with customizable location data.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3 (preferably `Python 3.6.9`)

that's it actually :)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/cupskeee/python-near-location.git`
2. Modify your location data on the provided data source `data.py` or `data.csv`

You can modify the location data on `data.py` or `data.csv` by following the default format.
